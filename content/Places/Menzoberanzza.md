A highly magical city of dark elves in the Underdark. 

The teleportation circle to reach this place is located on top of a 200 cliff next to the city.

Only dark elves walk around on their own. All other races are slaves that follow behind their owner. Everyone in this city also wear cloaks with their house's insignia.
