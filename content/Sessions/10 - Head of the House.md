# Notes

We navigate into another room with teleportation circles. [[Bird Hat]] and [[Ashken]] go through these but don't really find much beyond caves that open up to unknown locations.

After that, we meet 3 dark elf ladies. One being the head of the house, an arch mage.

[[Thumper]] goes to sit with them an talk. They appear to possibly be vampiric.
