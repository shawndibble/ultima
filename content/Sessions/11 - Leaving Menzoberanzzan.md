# Notes
## The Matriarch is Dead

[[Ba'dr]] decapitates the 3 dark elves. After looting them, we burn them to ash.

He then goes down to the group of the previous slaves to give them a choice to be freed. The ex-slaves decide to join us as we try to get them out.

[[Thumper]] identifies a bunch of magical gear.

[[Bird Hat]] works to find the Phylactery. At one point, he jumps and digs around the pile of ash. He eventually drinks the blood. He glows with the energy of the Phylactery and he finds some kind of magical stone.

## Leaving the Underdark

We decide to explore the teleportation room. [[Ashken]] ends up finding a teleportation.

We find a teleportation location directly above the city of [[Menzoberanzzan]] which might be worth something but [[Rodger]] has no idea how to help us. 

We decide to walk through the city to find a way to the cliff opening. [[Ashken]] scouts ahead to see how we can get everyone out of the city and back to [[Baldur's Gate]].

We Dimension Door all the refugees and then teleport back to [[Baldur's Gate]].

## Back in Baldur's Gate

[[Ba'dr]] and [[Ashken]] travel to the common guild to get the 30 refugees setup in the city. They pay the 50 gold per person to set them up for a year.

[[Bird Hat]] and [[Thumper]] seeks help with [[Rodger]] on this glowing energy coming from Bird. Unfortunately, Rodger is unavailable, but pencils us in for tomorrow.

We then make our way to the other Phylactery people in the sewers.
