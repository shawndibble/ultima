# Notes

[[Ba'dr]] rides off to Daggerford, but ends up not actually going. While he is out running his own errands, a bird flies down and requests that we follow it to meet its master. We are directed to a secret location through the sewers.

We meet the head priestess of [[The Many Faced God]] and she tells us that when the god comes, it will change everything about the realms, it is impossible to stop this. We can only ensure the safety of the world by being in control of how it returns.

In order to control this god, we must find the 7 phylacteries.
