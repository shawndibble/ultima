<< [[14 - Tyr's Temple]] | [[16 - A Priestess and A Phylactery]]>>

# Notes

We continue our fight and at one point, he teleports away with [[Thumper]]. 

Thumper is taken to a celestial plane in which the celestial being discusses his desire to work with me in preventing the return of the many face god. He also gives me an item so that he can contact me later.

[[Ba'dr]] finds a pregnant lady ([[Release all the Phylacteries|the first phylactery]]) as well as the blind Priestess and threatens them. Then puts them to sleep.

[[Bird Hat]] returns and awakens the Priestess. We take the two to an inn for the night.
