> [!tldr] Summary
> We report to Rodger about the magical box, revealing it’s meant to prevent The Many Faced God's return. Later, we find the manor’s servants dead and discover Rodger investigating. Crows follow us around, and we receive a mission from the guild to urgently deliver a letter to a distant tower.
# Notes

We head off to the headmaster of the mage's guild named [[Rodger]]. We explain everything that happened to us the night before with the box.

> [!NOTE] Box rune translation
> Guard the shadows, prevent [[The Many Faced God]] from returning.

We are sent to a library. [[Ba'dr]] steals an old book.

We return to the manor and search it. There is a glamour spell on it. All the servants are dead & ripped apart. While using [[Thumper]] owl, we see that [[Rodger]] is performing an investigation.

During this time, crows are following us around.

The party returns to the guild hall while [[Ba'dr]] goes to investigate the book. We have a letter for a courier job from the mage's guild.

> [!IMPORTANT] Mission
> We are to deliver the letter to a tower hundreds of miles away ASAP.

> [!INFO] We reach level 7
