# Notes

Agatha wakes up the next day. Nothing of note really reveals itself.

Our note card tells us to return to the merchant goblin for our magical items. [[Ba'dr]] returns to the mage's guild instead. [[Thumper]] receives the [Peregrine Helm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/316764-peregrine-mask) in exchange for a drop of blood. [[Ashken]] and [[Bird Hat]] also make similar deals for magical items.

We return to the manor and investigate. [[Bird Hat]] finds a Medusa illusion and we discover a letter.
> [!quote] The many faced god awakens from his slumber. We must release the pieces. Death to all gods.

The 3 of us returns to the mage's guild and pick up [[Ba'dr]] who has attacked the receptionist. We take the attached receptionist to our place but return to the guild the next day. In doing so, we also return the mage crest we picked up from the mages who attacked us at the tower ([[5 - The Interrogation]]). 

[[Thumper]] goes off to one of the grand libraries to investigate [[The Many Faced God]]. He discovers that a phylactery maybe located in the [[Moonshade Isles]]. 

[[Rodger]] teleports us to the island and we find what we are looking for in the form of an old woman guarded/held by an Aasimar. We [banish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2010-banishment) him, but in doing so, the old woman disappears and escapes.
