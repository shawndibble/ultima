# Notes

Agatha wakes up the next day. Nothing of note really reveals itself.

Our note card tells us to return to the merchant goblin for our magical items. [[Ba'dr]] returns to the mage's guild instead. [[Thumper]] receives the [Peregrine Helm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/316764-peregrine-mask) in exchange for a drop of blood. [[Ashken]] and [[Bird Hat]] also make similar deals for magical items.

We return to the manor and investigate. [[Bird Hat]] finds a Medusa illusion and we discover a letter.

The 3 of us returns to the mage's guild and pick up [[Ba'dr]] who has attacked the receptionist. We take the attached receptionist to our place but return to the guild the next day
