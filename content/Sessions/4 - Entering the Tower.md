# Notes

We enter the tower which is a large empty room. It is sealed but we manage to open a door way to another world on a beach.

We meet the goddess of Minthara. They are trapped & wants us to be their "avatar". What we need to do will be revealed in time.

> [!tip] We are to be the avatars of Minthara.

We return to the tower where a team from the mage's guild shows up to arrest us. Instead we end up getting into a fight and killing all but 2. We begin to interrogate the priest.

> [!INFO] We reach level 8
