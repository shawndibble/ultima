# Notes

We start out meeting [[Theo]] at our guild [[Ultima]] in [[Baldur's Gate]]. We are given a quest to deliver a package discretely. 

The package is an extravagant jewelry box that should be dropped off at the Asslot family. We were suppose to deliver the package to a man down an ally to the side of the house.

During transport, the box kept trying to break free and was dropped and opened. A magical feeling of the box was released when it opened. 

When we arrived at our destination, we find a corpse which we figure was our delivery target.

[[Ba'dr]] returns to [[Ultima]] with the box.

[[Bird Hat]] investigates the mansion and discovers a few things.
1. The duke & his daughters are not in the manor.
2. He retrieves an insignia for the manor

[[Ba'dr]] tries to run off with the box after [[Theo]] confronts him. We catch up to him and realize the box stinks of failed magic. Ancient runic magic was all over the insides of it, as if someone/something was casting magic from the inside.

In the end, we all lose our jobs at [[Ultima]] but are still paid.
