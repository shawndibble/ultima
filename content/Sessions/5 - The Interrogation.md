# Notes

During the interrogation of the survivor, we find out they believe we are cultists of [[The Many Faced God]].

> [!todo] Release the god's soul bound phylacteries

After the interrogation, we begin our trip back to [[Baldur's Gate]]. We encounter some "goblins" who are especially touch for what they are and fade to another realm when they die. Unfortunately we find nothing after the fight.

Upon returning to the city, we discover that [[IO]] took down our guild crests and took both [[Theo]] and his with them.

[[Ba'dr]] goes to a the mage's guild on his own to find some information about the attack. Even though we killed some of 'their members', he returns fine with no answers.

We then go to a seer named Agatha to look into the mind of [[Ba'dr]], but the seer falls into a coma that is of celestial origin. Even [[Thumper]] is unable to heal Agatha and his healing is blocked by his god.

We stay the night
