# Notes

## Supply Shopping

We meet a mysterious shop keeper we found making 3 left turns down a specific alley. He may get us any number of items we need, but we have to come back later. He gives us a "card" that will let us know when to return.

We also go to the emporium where we get a [Ring of Protection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4726-ring-of-protection) and a [Bag of Holding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4581-bag-of-holding) which we put on our guild's tab ([[Ultima]]).

## Heading out.

We utilize a teleportation circle to go to Dagger form (a town halfway to the tower), but we arrive at night when everything is closed. [[Ba'dr]] and [[Ashken]] steal horses while [[Bird Hat]] distracts the boy watching the stables. And ride out towards the tower.

During the night we are attacked. The head enemy retreats saying "He's coming".

## Reaching the tower

We make it to the tower without any further conflict. About half a mile away we pass some kind of field that prevents the crows from continuing to follow us.
