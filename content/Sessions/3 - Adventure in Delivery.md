> We meet a mysterious shopkeeper who gives us a card for future visits and items. We teleport to Daggerford but arrive at night, so Ba'dr and Ashken steal horses with Bird Hat's help and head toward the tower. We are attacked during the night, but eventually reach the tower and pass a field that stops the crows from following.
# Notes

## Supply Shopping

We meet a mysterious shop keeper we found making 3 left turns down a specific alley. He may get us any number of items we need, but we have to come back later. He gives us a "card" that will let us know when to return.

We also go to the emporium where we get a [Ring of Protection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4726-ring-of-protection) and a [Bag of Holding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4581-bag-of-holding) which we put on our guild's tab ([[Ultima]]).

## Heading out.

We utilize a teleportation circle to go to Daggerford (a town halfway to the tower), but we arrive at night when everything is closed. [[Ba'dr]] and [[Ashken]] steal horses while [[Bird Hat]] distracts the boy watching the stables. And ride out towards the tower.

During the night we are attacked. The head enemy retreats saying "He's coming".

## Reaching the tower

We make it to the tower without any further conflict. About half a mile away we pass some kind of field that prevents the crows from continuing to follow us.
