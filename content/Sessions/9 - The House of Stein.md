# Notes

We manage to get to the center of town. The group hides in an alley while [[Ba'dr]] goes off to fine more information. Specifically where the House of Stein is.

He finds its location and we get there. We all sneak into the property around the side of the house. For the most case, the place is very quiet. Eventually, we get into the house and locate staff who have taken over the house and are seeking to escape the city. They inform us the ladies of the house are in the upper floors.

We go investigate the upper floors. The rest of the house has no one, we do find the corpses of a few dark elves who have been stuffed in a closet. Eventually we locate a secret room with a spider puzzle room. [[Bird Hat]] almost gets himself stabbed, but we save him in time. We utilize one of the corpses on the spider puzzle which drains the body and opens another room.
