# Notes

[[Thumper]] sent out his familiar to find back birds but it returned and find nothing. Upon returning he sees that [[Ba'dr]] and [[Ashken]] are in combat with a Deva. 

[[Ba'dr]] cats fear on the Deva before it hugs him. Instead of screams and throws him. I put the Deva in a wall of force who then disappears. [[Ba'dr]] is not responding to questions so I turn invisible and flee the scene. 

Our group meets back up and [[Ashken]] has an inky black bird on his head. It collapses into a map pointing where we need to go. 

He head to the church it marks.
