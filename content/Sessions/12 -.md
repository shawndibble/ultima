# Notes

The gnome we picked up from the dark elves house is sticking with us. His name is [[Til'hawk]]. [[Ba'dr]] gives his gnome friend a bunch of gear.

When [[Bird Hat]] and [[Thumper]] goes to to sewers, we find the door to be locked and the guards are missing. 

When we get into the room, we find a bunch of corpses of the guards. The Priestess is missing. The area is consecrated.
