<< [[11 - Leaving Menzoberanzzan]] | [[13 - Fight with a Deva]] >>
# Notes

The gnome we picked up from the dark elves house is sticking with us. His name is [[Til'hawk]]. [[Ba'dr]] gives his gnome friend a bunch of gear.

## Sewers

When [[Bird Hat]] and [[Thumper]] goes to to sewers, we find the door to be locked and the guards are missing. 

When we get into the room, we find a bunch of corpses of the guards. The area is consecrated. The Priestess is missing and probably taken by whatever church came through.

## Mage's Guild

We get to [[Rodger]] who has no information for us. He does get information about the teleport portals by identifying the dark elf crests on us.

## Searching for the Priestess

We check out the churches in the area of the good gods. We do not find any of the crows from our Priestess. 

[[Ba'dr]] picks a fight with a deva.
# Quests

 * Priestess possibly taken by a cleric of one of the good gods in [[Baldur's Gate]].
