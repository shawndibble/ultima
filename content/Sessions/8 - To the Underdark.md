# Notes

The high priestess informs us that the next piece of the phylactery is located in [[Menzoberranza]] and is under control by the House of Stein. We do not have any other information.

We go to the mage's guild and [[Rodger]] helps teleports us to our destination but warns us to ensure we do not disturb the teleportation circle when we arrive.

Upon arrival, we are attacked by monsters but we dispatch them. We also notice that we are on a cliff that is 200 ft up. We have few options to get down. [[Bird Hat]] and [[Ba'dr]]
